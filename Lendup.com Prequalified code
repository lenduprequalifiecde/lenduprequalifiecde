In recent years, an increasing number of financial institutions have begun offering payday loans to the general public. Loans of this nature, as the name suggests, are different from traditional loans in the sense that the amount borrowed is secured against the recipients forthcoming pay check, as opposed to standard bank loans that are paid back over an extended period of time.

Some Industry Heavy Hitters

It is becoming increasingly easy to find providers of payday loans online, the most well known of which include companies such as Wonga, Quick Quid and Payday Power.

The premise is very simple - if you need a sum of money quickly, usually in the region of fifty to a thousand pounds, these companies allow you to apply for their available payday loans online and the requested amount will usually be deposited into the applicant's bank account within a few hours at the most.
